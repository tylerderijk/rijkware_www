    "Our mission is to empower IT students by providing real-world experience that complements their academic learning and prepares them for successful careers.",
    "Many students are employed in roles that do not align with their career ambitions, such as in supermarkets or the catering industry. While these jobs are valuable, they do not leverage the technical skills students are developing. We aim to change this by connecting students with projects that directly relate to their future careers, allowing them to apply their knowledge meaningfully.",
    "Businesses often hesitate to involve students in significant projects, assuming that only graduates have the necessary experience. This overlooks the potential of students to contribute effectively when given the right opportunities. At Rijkware, we identify projects suitable for students and show businesses that these projects can be managed effectively by them.",
    "We are committed to fostering a culture of professionalism, continuous improvement, and inclusion. By challenging existing prejudices against student capabilities, we aim to create a job market where students are recognized as valuable contributors alongside full-time professionals."
