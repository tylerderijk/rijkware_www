    "Our mission is to help IT students gain real-world experience that complements their academic studies, preparing them for successful careers in their chosen fields.",
    "Many students currently find employment in supermarkets or the catering industry, even though they could be engaging in projects that are more closely related to their future careers.",
    "From the early years of their studies, IT students are exposed to the latest technologies and learn how to implement them in practical settings.",
    "Businesses often prefer to hire graduates, under the assumption that only they possess the necessary experience to contribute effectively.",
    "Certainly, some projects require more experience and may be too complex for students. However, many projects are well within their capabilities and can be managed by students effectively.",
    "At Rijkware, we aim to identify such projects and convince businesses that students can indeed meet their needs effectively and efficiently.",
    "We mitigate the risk for businesses by offering clear contracts that precisely outline what the student will deliver and by when, ensuring transparency and accountability.",
    "During their employment, students are required to provide weekly or monthly progress reports to showcase the work they have accomplished, reinforcing a culture of professionalism and continuous improvement.",
    "We are committed to a culture of continuous improvement, diversity, and inclusion. We see every challenge as an opportunity to learn, and every success as a cause for celebration.",
    "Ultimately, we hope to challenge and change the prevailing prejudices against student capabilities, advocating for their inclusion in the job market alongside full-time professionals."
